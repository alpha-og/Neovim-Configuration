# Neovim Configuration
This repository serves to host my Neovim configuration and also (potentially) explain and clarify the process of setting up Neovim. This configuration is a combination of different configurations I've come across. I've just started exploring Neovim and so this configuration is in no way perfect. If you're looking for something thats stable and easy to setup, I suggest you take a look at some of the alternative distros for a quick-start.
